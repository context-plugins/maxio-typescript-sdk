  /**
   * Preview Renewal
   *
   * @remarks
   * Previews a subscription’s next renewal assessment. Renewal Preview is an object representing a
   * subscription’s next assessment. You can retrieve it to see a snapshot of how much your customer
   * will be charged on their next renewal.
   *
   * The "Next Billing" amount and "Next Billing" date are already represented in the UI on each
   * Subscriber's Summary. For more information, see [Subscriber Interface
   * Overview](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252493695757-Subscriber-Interface-Overview).
   *
   * ## Optional Component Fields
   *
   * This endpoint is particularly useful because it returns the computed billing amount for the
   * base product and the components which are in use by a subscriber.
   *
   * By default, the preview includes billing details for all components _at their **current**
   * quantities_. This means:
   *
   * * Current `allocated_quantity` for quantity-based components
   * * Current enabled/disabled status for on/off components
   * * Current metered usage `unit_balance` for metered components
   * * Current metric quantity value for events recorded thus far for events-based components
   *
   * In the above statements, "current" means the quantity or value as of the call to the renewal
   * preview endpoint. End-of-period values for components are not predicted, so metered or
   * events-based usage may be less than it will eventually be at the end of the period.
   *
   * Optionally, **you can provide your own custom quantities** for any component to see a billing
   * preview for non-current quantities. This is accomplished by sending a request body with data
   * under the `components` key. See the request body documentation below.
   *
   * ## Preview Behavior
   *
   * Sending a `POST` request to this endpoint returns preview data without modifying the
   * subscription. This method previews data, but does not log any changes against a subscription.
   *
   * @returns OK
   *
   * @throws {@link SubscriptionStatus.PreviewRenewalError} when the API answers with an error
   * status — narrow on `err.payload.kind`
   *

   * timeout, a body that would not decode, a value that would not encode, or a credential that

  /**
   * Reactivate Subscription
   *
   * @remarks
   * Reactivates a previously canceled subscription. For details on how the reactivation works, and
   * how to reactivate subscriptions through the application, see
   * [reactivation](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252109503629-Reactivating-and-Resuming).
   *
   * **Note: The term "resume" is used also during another process in Advanced Billing. This occurs
   * when an on-hold subscription is "resumed". This returns the subscription to an active state.**
   *
   * + The response returns the subscription object in the `active` or `trialing` state.
   * + The `canceled_at` and `cancellation_message` fields do not have values.
   * + The method works for "Canceled" or "Trial Ended" subscriptions.
   * + It will not work for items not marked as "Canceled", "Unpaid", or "Trial Ended".
   *
   * ## Resume the current billing period for a subscription
   *
   * A subscription is considered "resumable" if you are attempting to reactivate within the billing
   * period the subscription was canceled in.
   *
   * A resumed subscription's billing date remains the same as before it was canceled. In other
   * words, it does not start a new billing period. Payment may or may not be collected for a
   * resumed subscription, depending on whether or not the subscription had a balance when it was
   * canceled (for example, if it was canceled because of dunning).
   *
   * Consider a subscription which was created on June 1st, and would renew on July 1st. The
   * subscription is then canceled on June 15.
   *
   * If a reactivation with `resume: true` were attempted _before_ what would have been the next
   * billing date of July 1st, then Advanced Billing would resume the subscription.
   *
   * If a reactivation with `resume: true` were attempted _after_ what would have been the next
   * billing date of July 1st, then Advanced Billing would not resume the subscription, and instead
   * it would be reactivated with a new billing period.
   *
   * If a reactivation with `resume: false`, or where 'resume' is omitted were attempted, then
   * Advanced Billing would reactivate the subscription with a new billing period regardless of
   * whether or not resuming the previous billing period was possible.
   *
   * | Canceled | Reactivation | Resumable? |
   * |---|---|---|
   * | Jun 15 | June 28 | Yes |
   * | Jun 15 | July 2 | No |
   *
   * ## Reactivation Scenarios
   *
   * ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription While Preserving Balance
   *
   * + Given you have a product that costs $20
   * + Given you have a canceled subscription to the $20 product
   *     + 1 charge should exist for $20
   *     + 1 payment should exist for $20
   * + When the subscription has canceled due to dunning, it retained a negative balance of $20
   *
   * #### Results
   *
   * The resulting charges upon reactivation will be:
   * + 1 charge for $20 for the new product
   * + 1 charge for $20 for the balance due
   * + Total charges = $40
   *
   * + The subscription will transition to active
   * + The subscription balance will be zero
   *
   * ### Reactivating a Canceled Subscription With Coupon
   *
   * + Given you have a canceled subscription
   * + It has no current period defined
   * + You have a coupon code "EARLYBIRD"
   * + The coupon is set to recur for 6 periods
   *
   * PUT request sent to:
   * `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?coupon_code=EARLYBIRD`
   *
   * #### Results
   *
   * + The subscription will transition to active
   * + The subscription should have applied a coupon with code "EARLYBIRD"
   *
   * ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription With a Trial, Without the include_trial Flag
   *
   * + Given you have a canceled subscription
   * + The product associated with the subscription has a trial
   *
   * + PUT request to `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json`
   *
   *
   * #### Results
   * + The subscription will transition to active
   *
   * ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription With Trial, With the include_trial Flag
   *
   * + Given you have a canceled subscription
   * + The product associated with the subscription has a trial
   *
   * + Send a PUT request to
   *   `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?include_trial=1`
   *
   *
   * #### Results
   *
   * + The subscription will transition to trialing
   *
   * ### Reactivating Trial Ended Subscription
   *
   * + Given you have a trial_ended subscription
   * + Send a PUT request to
   *   `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json`
   *
   * #### Results
   *
   * + The subscription will transition to active
   *
   * ### Resuming a Canceled Subscription
   *
   * + Given you have a `canceled` subscription and it is resumable
   * + Send a PUT request to
   *   `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true`
   *
   * #### Results
   *
   * + The subscription will transition to active
   * + The next billing date should not have changed
   *
   * ### Attempting to resume a subscription which is not resumable
   *
   * + Given you have a `canceled` subscription, and it is not resumable
   * + Send a PUT request to
   *   `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true`
   *
   * #### Results
   *
   * + The subscription will transition to active, with a new billing period.
   *
   * ### Attempting to resume but not reactivate a subscription which is not resumable
   *
   * + Given you have a `canceled` subscription, and it is not resumable
   * + Send a PUT request to
   *   `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume[require_resume]=true`
   * + The response status should be "422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY"
   * + The subscription should be canceled with the following response
   * ```
   *   {
   *     "errors": ["Request was 'resume only', but this subscription cannot be resumed."]
   *   }
   * ```
   *
   * #### Results
   *
   * + The subscription should remain `canceled`
   * + The next billing date should not have changed
   *
   * ### Resuming Subscription Which Was Trialing
   *
   * + Given you have a `trial_ended` subscription, and it is resumable
   * + And the subscription was canceled in the middle of a trial
   * + And there is still time left on the trial
   * + Send a PUT request to
   *   `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true`
   *
   * #### Results
   *
   * + The subscription will transition to trialing
   * + The next billing date should not have changed
   *
   * ### Resuming Subscription Which Was trial_ended
   *
   * + Given you have a `trial_ended` subscription, and it is resumable
   * + Send a PUT request to
   *   `https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true`
   *
   * #### Results
   *
   * + The subscription will transition to active
   * + The next billing date should not have changed
   * + Any product-related charges should have been collected
   *
