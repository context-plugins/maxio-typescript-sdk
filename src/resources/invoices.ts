  /**
   * Create Invoice
   *
   * @remarks
   * Creates an ad hoc invoice.
   *
   * ### Basic Behavior
   *
   * You can create a basic invoice by sending an array of line items to this endpoint. Each line
   * item, at a minimum, must include a title, a quantity and a unit price. Example:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "invoice": {
   *     "line_items": [
   *       {
   *         "title": "A Product",
   *         "quantity": 12,
   *         "unit_price": "150.00"
   *       }
   *     ]
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * ### Catalog items
   * Instead of creating custom products like in above example, You can pass existing items like
   * products, components.
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "invoice": {
   *     "line_items": [
   *       {
   *         "product_id": "handle:gold-product",
   *         "quantity": 2,
   *       }
   *     ]
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   *
   * The price for each line item will be calculated as well as a total due amount for the invoice.
   * Multiple line items can be sent.
   *
   * ### Line item types
   * When defining a line item, You can choose one of 3 types for a line item:
   * #### Custom item
   * As shown in the basic behavior example, You can pass `title` and `unit_price` for custom item.
   * #### Product id
   * Product handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site can be
   * provided with `product_id`. By default `unit_price` is taken from product's default price
   * point, but can be overwritten by passing `unit_price` or `product_price_point_id`. If
   * `product_id` is used, following fields cannot be used: `title`, `component_id`.
   * #### Component id
   * Component handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site can
   * be provided with `component_id`. If `component_id` is used, following fields cannot be used:
   * `title`, `product_id`. By default `unit_price` is taken from product's default price point, but
   * can be overwritten by passing `unit_price` or `price_point_id`. At this moment price points are
   * supported only for quantity based, on/off and metered components. For prepaid and event based
   * billing components `unit_price` is required.
   *
   * ### Coupons
   * When creating ad hoc invoice, new discounts can be applied in following way:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "invoice": {
   *     "line_items": [
   *       {
   *         "product_id": "handle:gold-product",
   *         "quantity": 1
   *       }
   *     ],
   *     "coupons": [
   *       {
   *         "code": "COUPONCODE",
   *         "percentage": 50.0
   *       }
   *     ]
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * If You want to use existing coupon for discount creation, only `code` and optional
   * `product_family_id` is needed
   *
   * ```json
   * ...
   *  "coupons": [
   *       {
   *         "code": "FREESETUP",
   *         "product_family_id": 1
   *       }
   *   ]
   * ...
   * ```
   *
   * #### Using Coupon Subcodes
   * You can also use coupon subcodes to apply existing coupons with specific subcodes:
   *
   * ```json
   * ...
   *  "coupons": [
   *       {
   *         "subcode": "SUB1",
   *         "product_family_id": 1
   *       }
   *   ]
   * ...
   * ```
   * **Important:** You cannot specify both `code` and `subcode` for the same coupon. Use either:
   * - `code` to apply a main coupon
   * - `subcode` to apply a specific coupon subcode
   *
   * The API response will include both the main coupon code and the subcode used:
   *
   * ```json
   * ...
   *  "coupons": [
   *       {
   *         "code": "MAIN123",
   *         "subcode": "SUB1",
   *         "product_family_id": 1,
   *         "percentage": 10,
   *         "description": "Special discount"
   *       }
   *   ]
   * ...
   * ```
   *
   * ### Coupon options
   * #### Code
   * Coupon `code` will be displayed on invoice discount section. Coupon code can only contain
   * uppercase letters, numbers, and allowed special characters. Lowercase letters will be converted
   * to uppercase. It can be used to select an existing coupon from the catalog, or as an ad hoc
   * coupon when passed with `percentage` or `amount`.
   * #### Subcode
   * Coupon `subcode` allows you to apply existing coupons using their subcodes. When a subcode is
   * used, the API response will include both the main coupon code and the specific subcode that was
   * applied. Subcodes are case-insensitive and will be converted to uppercase automatically.
   * #### Percentage
   * Coupon `percentage` can take values from 0 to 100 and up to 4 decimal places. It cannot be used
   * with `amount`. Only for ad hoc coupons, will be ignored if `code` is used to select an existing
   * coupon from the catalog.
   * #### Amount
   * Coupon `amount` takes number value. It cannot be used with `percentage`. Used only when not
   * matching existing coupon by `code`.
   * #### Description
   * Optional `description` will be displayed with coupon `code`. Used only when not matching
   * existing coupon by `code`.
   * #### Product Family id
   * Optional `product_family_id` handle (with handle: prefix) or id is used to match existing
   * coupon within site, when codes are not unique.
   * #### Compounding Strategy
   * Optional `compounding_strategy` for percentage coupons, can take values `compound` or
   * `full-price`.
   *
   * For amount coupons, discounts will be always calculated against the original item price, before
   * other discounts are applied.
   *
   * `compound` strategy: Percentage-based discounts will be calculated against the remaining price,
   * after prior discounts have been calculated. It is set by default.
   *
   * `full-price` strategy: Percentage-based discounts will always be calculated against the
   * original item price, before other discounts are applied.
   *
   * ### Line Item Options
   *
   * #### Period Date Range
   *
   * A custom period date range can be defined for each line item with the `period_range_start` and
   * `period_range_end` parameters. Dates must be sent in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
   * `period_range_end` must be greater or equal `period_range_start`.
   *
   * #### Taxes
   *
   * The `taxable` parameter can be sent as `true` if taxes should be calculated for a specific line
   * item. For this to work, the site should be configured to use and calculate taxes. Further, if
   * the site uses Avalara for tax calculations, a `tax_code` parameter should also be sent. For
   * existing catalog items: products/components taxes cannot be overwritten.
   *
   * #### Price Point
   * Price point handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site
   * can be provided with `price_point_id` for components with `component_id` or
   * `product_price_point_id` for products with `product_id` parameter. If price point is passed
   * `unit_price` cannot be used. It can be used only with catalog items products and components.
   *
   * #### Description
   * Optional `description` parameter, it will overwrite default generated description for line
   * item.
   *
   * ### Invoice Options
   *
   * #### Issue Date
   *
   * By default, invoices will be created with a issue date set to today in your site's time zone.
   * The `issue_date` parameter can be sent to alter the default. Only today or dates in the past
   * are accepted. This date is interpreted and validated in your site's time zone. The format for
   * `issue_date` is `YYYY-MM-DD`.
   *
   * #### Net Terms
   *
   * By default, invoices will be created with a due date matching the date of invoice creation. If
   * a different due date is desired, the `net_terms` parameter can be sent indicating the number of
   * days in advance the due date should be.
   *
   * #### Addresses
   *
   * The seller, shipping and billing addresses can be sent to override the site's defaults. Each
   * address requires to send a `first_name` at a minimum in order to work. See below for the
   * details on which parameters can be sent for each address object.
   *
   * #### Memo and Payment Instructions
   *
   * A custom memo can be sent with the `memo` parameter to override the site's default. Likewise,
   * custom payment instructions can be sent with the `payment_instructions` parameter.
   *
   * #### Status
   *
   * By default, invoices will be created with open status. Possible alternative is `draft`.
   *
   * @returns OK
   *
   * @throws {@link Invoices.CreateInvoiceError} when the API answers with an error status — narrow

   * @throws {@link MaxioError} when no usable response was produced: a connection failure, a
   * timeout, a body that would not decode, a value that would not encode, or a credential that
   * could not be obtained

  /**
   * Issue Invoice
   *
   * @remarks
   * Issues an invoice that is in "pending" or "draft" status. For example, you can issue an invoice
   * that was created when allocating new quantity on a component and using "accrue charges" option.
   *
   * You cannot issue a pending child invoice that was created for a member subscription in a group.
   *
   * For Remittance subscriptions, the invoice will go into "open" status and payment won't be
   * attempted. The value for `on_failed_payment` would be rejected if sent. Any prepayments or
   * service credits that exist on the subscription will be automatically applied. Additionally, if
   * the setting is enabled, an email will be sent for the issued invoice.
   *
   * For Automatic subscriptions, prepayments and service credits will apply to the invoice before
   * payment is attempted. On successful payment, the invoice will go into "paid" status and email
   * will be sent to the customer (if setting applies). When payment fails, the next event depends
   * on the `on_failed_payment` value:
   * - `leave_open_invoice` - prepayments and credits applied to invoice; invoice status set to
   *   "open"; email sent to the customer for the issued invoice (if setting applies); payment
   *   failure recorded in the invoice history. This is the default option.
   * - `rollback_to_pending` - prepayments and credits not applied; invoice remains in "pending"
   *   status; no email sent to the customer; payment failure recorded in the invoice history.
   * - `initiate_dunning` - prepayments and credits applied to the invoice; invoice status set to
   *   "open"; email sent to the customer for the issued invoice (if setting applies); payment

  /**
   * Update Draft Ad Hoc Invoice
   *
   * @remarks
   * Updates an ad hoc invoice while it is in the `draft` state.
   *
   * **Important: only invoices with the `adhoc` role and `draft` status can be updated.** Any other
   * invoice — issued, or with a different role (e.g. `renewal`, `signup`) — cannot be updated
   * through this endpoint and the request returns a `422` error. If the invoice does not belong to
   * the provided subscription, a `404` error is returned.
   *
   * Only the attributes submitted in the request are changed — omitted attributes keep their
   * current values.
   *
   * ### Line Items
   *
   * The `line_items` array describes changes to the invoice's line items. Line items not referenced
   * in the array remain unchanged.
   *
   * #### Adding a line item
   *
   * A line item without a `uid` is added to the invoice. The same line item types and options as on
   * invoice creation are supported (custom items, `product_id`, `component_id`, price points,
   * period date ranges, taxes).
   *
   * #### Updating a line item
   *
   * A line item with the `uid` of an existing line item updates that line item with the submitted
   * attributes. Amounts and taxes are recalculated.
   *
   * #### Removing a line item
   *
   * A line item with a `uid` and `"_destroy": true` is removed from the invoice. Other line items
   * remain unchanged.
   *
   * Referencing a `uid` which does not exist on the invoice returns a `422` error.
   *
   * ### Coupons
   *
   * When the `coupons` key is present, the submitted coupons replace all discounts currently
   * applied to the invoice. Send an empty array to remove all discounts. Coupon options are the
   * same as on invoice creation.
   *
   * ### Invoice Options
   *
   * #### Issue Date and Net Terms
   *
   * The `issue_date` parameter can be sent to change the invoice's issue date. Only today or dates
   * in the past are accepted. The date is interpreted and validated in your site's time zone, using
   * the `YYYY-MM-DD` format. The `net_terms` parameter indicates the number of days after the issue
   * date on which the invoice is due. The due date is recalculated whenever the issue date or net
   * terms change.
   *
   * #### Addresses
   *
   * The seller, shipping and billing addresses can be sent to replace the addresses on the invoice.
   * Each address requires to send a `first_name` at a minimum in order to work. Taxes are
   * recalculated after an address change.
   *
   * #### Memo and Payment Instructions
   *
   * A custom memo can be sent with the `memo` parameter. Likewise, custom payment instructions can
   * be sent with the `payment_instructions` parameter.
   *
   * @returns OK
   *
   * @throws {@link Invoices.UpdateInvoiceError} when the API answers with an error status — narrow
   * on `err.payload.kind`
   *
   * @throws {@link MaxioError} when no usable response was produced: a connection failure, a
