  /**
   * Create Customer
   *
   * @remarks
   * Creates a new customer; can also be created alongside a new subscription. The only validation
   * restriction is that you can only create one customer for a given reference value.
   *
   * If provided, the `reference` value must be unique. It represents a unique identifier for the
   * customer from your own app, i.e. the customer’s ID. This allows you to retrieve a given
   * customer via a piece of shared information. Alternatively, you can choose to leave `reference`
   * blank, and store the system-assigned unique ID for the customer, which is in the `id`
   * attribute.
   *
   * For more information, see [Customer
   * Details](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252190590093-Customer-Details).
   *
   * ## Required Country Format
   *
   * Format the country attribute of the customer using the ISO Standard Country codes.
   *
   * Countries should be formatted as two characters. For more information, see [ISO
   * 3166-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes).
   *
   * ## Required State Format
   *
   * Format the state attribute of the customer using the ISO Standard State codes.
   *
   * + US States (two characters): see [ISO 3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:US).
   *
   * + States Outside the US (two to three characters): To find the correct state codes outside the
   *   US, go to [ISO 3166-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes) and click on
   *   the link in the “ISO 3166-2 codes” column next to the country you wish to populate.
   *
   * ## Locale
   *
   * You can attribute a language/region to the customer to deliver invoices in any required
   * language. For more information, see [Customer
   * Locale](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24286672013709-Customer-Locale).
   *
   * ## Tax and Business Identifiers
   *
   * Send `entity_identifier_kind` and `entity_identifier_value` together to store the customer's
   * tax or business identifier, such as an EU VAT number, a French SIREN, or a LEI. A customer
   * holds one identifier at a time.
   *
   * The `vat_eu` and `national_tax` kinds also require `vat_country`. An unsupported kind, a
   * missing or mismatched `vat_country`, or a `gln`, `duns`, or `lei` value in the wrong format
   * returns `422`.
   *
   * Always send the kind. `entity_identifier_value` on its own is stored as a `company_reg` when no
   * `vat_country` is present, and returns `422` naming `entity_identifier_kind` when one is.
   *
   * A blank pair is ignored rather than rejected, so a `vat_number` sent alongside it still takes
   * effect.
   *
   * The legacy `vat_number` and `vat_country` pair still works on its own. When neither entity
   * identifier field is sent, Advanced Billing derives the kind from `vat_country`: an EU member
   * state code or `GB` gives `vat_eu`, one of the national tax country codes gives `national_tax`,
   * and a blank or unrecognized country gives `company_reg`.
   *
   * The response reports the stored identifier in `entity_identifier_kind` and
   * `entity_identifier_value`, and repeats its value in `vat_number`.
   *
   * @returns OK
   *
   * @throws {@link Customers.CreateCustomerError} when the API answers with an error status —
   * narrow on `err.payload.kind`
   *
   * @throws {@link MaxioError} when no usable response was produced: a connection failure, a
   * timeout, a body that would not decode, a value that would not encode, or a credential that
   * could not be obtained

   * tax or business identifier, such as an EU VAT number, a French SIREN, or a LEI. A customer
   * holds one identifier at a time, so saving an identifier of a different kind replaces the
   * existing one.
   *
   * The `vat_eu` and `national_tax` kinds also require `vat_country`. An unsupported kind, a
   * missing or mismatched `vat_country`, or a `gln`, `duns`, or `lei` value in the wrong format
   * returns `422`.
   *
   * Always send the kind. `entity_identifier_value` on its own is stored as a `company_reg` when no
   * `vat_country` is present, and returns `422` naming `entity_identifier_kind` when one is.
   *
   * To clear an identifier, send a supported `entity_identifier_kind` with a blank
   * `entity_identifier_value`, or send a blank `vat_number` on its own. The first form also clears
   * `vat_number` and `vat_country`, and it removes whichever identifier the customer holds,
   * whatever kind you send with it.
   *
   * The legacy `vat_number` and `vat_country` pair still works on its own. When neither entity
   * identifier field is sent, Advanced Billing derives the kind from `vat_country`: an EU member
   * state code or `GB` gives `vat_eu`, one of the national tax country codes gives `national_tax`,
   * and a blank or unrecognized country gives `company_reg`.
   *
   * Sending a customer response straight back leaves the tax ID alone. A blank pair, and a pair
   * that still matches the stored identifier with `vat_country` unchanged, are read as nothing to
   * change rather than as a request to clear. For `gln`, `duns`, and `lei` that also covers the
   * `vat_number` the response mirrors back, so the kind survives the round trip.
   *
   * What you do change is applied, and the entity identifier fields take precedence over
   * `vat_number`. A different kind or value writes that identifier, and `vat_number` and
   * `vat_country` follow from it. A different `vat_country` next to an unchanged pair is a real
   * edit, so it is validated and can return `422`. Changing only `vat_number` leaves the pair
   * unchanged, so the derivation above decides the kind, which turns a `gln`, `duns`, or `lei`
   * customer into a `company_reg`. Setting `vat_number` to `null` or a blank string still clears
   * the identifier.
   *
   * The response reports the stored identifier in `entity_identifier_kind` and
   * `entity_identifier_value`, and repeats its value in `vat_number`.
