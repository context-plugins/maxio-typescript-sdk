   *
   * Event-based components are similar to other component types, in that you define the component
   * parameters (such as name and taxability) and the pricing. A key difference for the event-based
   * component is that it must be attached to a metric. This is because the metric provides the
   * component with the actual quantity used in computing what and how much will be billed each
   * period for each subscription.
   *
   * So, instead of reporting usage directly for each component (as you would with metered
   * components), the usage is derived from analysis of your events.
   *

   * Create Metered Component
   *
   * @remarks
   * Creates a metered component definition under the specified product family. A metered component
   * can then be added and “allocated” for a subscription.
   *
   * Metered components are used to bill for any type of unit that resets to 0 at the end of the
   * billing period (think daily Google Ads clicks or monthly cell phone minutes). This is most
   * commonly associated with usage-based billing and many other pricing schemes.
   *
   * Note that this is different from recurring quantity-based components, which DO NOT reset to
   * zero at the start of every billing period. If you want to bill for a quantity of something that
   * does not change unless you change it, then you want quantity components, instead.
   *
   * #### Hybrid Pricing
   * A `volume`, `tiered`, or `stairstep` metered component can combine its primary pricing with a
   * secondary pricing model (the `overage_pricing` parameter) so both bill as a single invoice line
   * item instead of two. This does not apply to metered components configured for event-based
   * billing (metric, meter, or formula). See [Hybrid
   * Pricing](page:introduction/basic-concepts/hybrid-pricing) for requirements and configuration
   * details.
   *
   * For more information on components, see our documentation

   * commonly associated with billing for user licenses, number of users, number of employees, etc.
   *
   * #### One-time
   * One-time quantity-based components are used to create ad hoc usage charges that do not recur.
   * For example, at the time of signup, you might want to charge your customer a one-time fee for
   * onboarding or other services.
   *
   * The allocated quantity for one-time quantity-based components immediately gets reset back to
