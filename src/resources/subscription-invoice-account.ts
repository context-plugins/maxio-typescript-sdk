   * Create Prepayment
   *
   * @remarks
   * Creates a prepayment for a subscription.
   *
   * In order to specify a prepayment made against a subscription, specify the `amount, memo,
   * details, method`.
   *
   * When the `method` specified is `"credit_card_on_file"`, the prepayment amount will be collected
   * using the default credit card payment profile and applied to the prepayment account balance.
   * This is especially useful for manual replenishment of prepaid subscriptions.
   *
   * Note that passing `amount_in_cents` is now allowed.
   *
   * ## 3D Secure (3DS) Authentication post-authentication flow
   *
   * When a payment requires 3DS Authentication to adhere to Strong Customer Authentication (SCA),
   * the request enters a post-authentication flow where a 422 Unprocessable Entity status is
   * returned with an action_link that will direct the customer through 3DS Authentication.
   *
   * See the [3D Secure Post-Authentication
   * Flow](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/44277749524365-3D-Secure-Post-Authentication-Flow)
   * article in the product documentation to learn how to manage the redirect flow.
