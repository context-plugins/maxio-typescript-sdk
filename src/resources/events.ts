  /**
   * List Events
   *
   * @remarks
   * Lists events for a site.
   *
   * Events include various activity that happens around a Site. This information is **especially**
   * useful to track down issues that arise when subscriptions are not created due to errors.
   *
   * Within the UI, Events are referred to as Site Activity. For more information, see [Site
   * Activity](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24250671733517-Site-Activity).
   *
   * Use query string filters to narrow down results. You can use the `filter` parameter to filter
   * by event key.
   *
   * ### Legacy Filters
   *
   * The following keys are no longer supported.
   *
   * + `payment_failure_recreated`
   * + `payment_success_recreated`
   * + `renewal_failure_recreated`
   * + `renewal_success_recreated`
   * + `zferral_revenue_post_failure` - (Specific to the deprecated Zferral integration)
   * + `zferral_revenue_post_success` - (Specific to the deprecated Zferral integration)
   *
   * ## Event Key
   * The event type is identified by the key property. See [Event Key]($m/Event%20Key) for a
   * complete list of supported keys.
   *
   * ## Event Specific Data
   *
   * Different event types may include additional data in `event_specific_data` property. While some
   * events share the same schema for `event_specific_data`, others may not include it at all. For
   * precise mappings from key to event_specific_data, refer to [Event]($m/Event).
   *
   * ### Example
   * Here’s an example event for the `subscription_product_change` event:
   *
   * ```
   * {
   *     "event": {
   *         "id": 351,
   *         "key": "subscription_product_change",
   *         "message": "Product changed on Mark Alan's subscription from 'Basic' to 'Pro'",
   *         "subscription_id": 205,
   *         "event_specific_data": {
   *             "new_product_id": 3,
   *             "previous_product_id": 2
   *         },
   *         "created_at": "2012-01-30T10:43:31-05:00"
   *     }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * Here’s an example event for the `subscription_state_change` event:
   *
   * ```
   *  {
   *      "event": {
   *          "id": 353,
   *          "key": "subscription_state_change",
   *          "message": "State changed on Mark Alan's subscription to Pro from trialing to active",
   *          "subscription_id": 205,
   *          "event_specific_data": {
   *              "new_subscription_state": "active",
   *              "previous_subscription_state": "trialing"
   *          },
   *          "created_at": "2012-01-30T10:43:33-05:00"
   *      }
   *  }
   * ```
   *

   *
   * If you’re using the [enhanced Catalog
   * experience](page:help/announcements/2026-announcements#new-catalog-experience-and-terminology),
