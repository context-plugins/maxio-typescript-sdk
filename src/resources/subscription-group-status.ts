  /**
   * Reactivate / Resume Subscription Group
   *
   * @remarks
   * Reactivates or resumes a cancelled subscription group. Upon reactivation, any canceled invoices
   * created after the beginning of the primary subscription's billing period will be reopened and
   * payment will be attempted on them. If the subscription group is being reactivated (as opposed
   * to resumed), new charges will also be assessed for the new billing period.
   *
   * Whether a subscription group is reactivated (a new billing period is created) or resumed (the
   * current billing period is respected) will depend on the parameters that are sent with the
   * request as well as the date of the request relative to the primary subscription's period.
   *
   * ## Reactivating within the current period
   *
   * If a subscription group is cancelled and reactivated within the primary subscription's current
   * period, we can choose to either start a new billing period or maintain the existing one. If we
   * want to maintain the existing billing period, the `resume=true` option must be passed in
   * request parameters.
   *
   * An exception to the above are subscriptions that are on calendar billing. These subscriptions
   * cannot be reactivated within the current period. If the `resume=true` option is not passed, the
   * request will return an error.
   *
   * The `resume_members` option is ignored in this case. All eligible group members will be
   * automatically resumed.
   *
   *
   * ## Reactivating beyond the current period
   *
   * In this case, a subscription group can only be reactivated with a new billing period. If the
   * `resume=true` option is passed it will be ignored.
   *
   * Member subscriptions can have billing periods that are longer than the primary (e.g. a monthly
   * primary with annual group members). If the primary subscription in a group cannot be
   * reactivated within the current period, but other group members can be, passing
   * `resume_members=true` will resume the existing billing period for eligible group members. The
   * primary subscription will begin a new billing period.
   *
   * For calendar billing subscriptions, the new billing period created will be a partial one,
   * spanning from the date of reactivation to the next corresponding calendar renewal date.
   *
   * ## 3D Secure (3DS) Authentication post-authentication flow
   *
   * When a payment requires 3DS Authentication to adhere to Strong Customer Authentication (SCA),
   * the request enters a post-authentication flow where a 422 Unprocessable Entity status is
   * returned with an action_link that will direct the customer through 3DS Authentication.
   *
   * See the [3D Secure Post-Authentication
   * Flow](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/44277749524365-3D-Secure-Post-Authentication-Flow)
   * article in the product documentation to learn how to manage the redirect flow.
   *
   * @returns OK
   *
   * @throws {@link SubscriptionGroupStatus.ReactivateSubscriptionGroupError} when the API answers
   * with an error status — narrow on `err.payload.kind`
