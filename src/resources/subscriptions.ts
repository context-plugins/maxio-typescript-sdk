  /**
   * Activate Subscription
   *
   * @remarks
   * Activates awaiting signup and trialing subscriptions. This feature is only available on the
   * Relationship Invoicing architecture. Subscriptions in a group cannot be activated immediately.
   *
   * The `revert_on_failure` parameter controls the behavior upon activation failure.
   * - If set to `true` and something goes wrong i.e. payment fails, the subscription's state does
   *   not change. The subscription’s billing period also remains the same.
   * - If set to `false` and something goes wrong i.e. payment fails, the activation continues and
   *   enters an end of life state. For trialing subscriptions, that is either trial ended (if the
   *   trial is no obligation), past due (if the trial has an obligation), or canceled (if the site
   *   has no dunning strategy, or has a strategy that says to cancel immediately). For awaiting
   *   signup subscriptions, that is always canceled.
   *
   * The default activation failure behavior can be configured per activation attempt, or you can
   * set a default value under Config > Settings > Subscription Activation Settings.
   *
   * ## Activation Scenarios
   *
   * ### Activate Awaiting Signup subscription
   *
   * - Given you have a product without trial
   * - Given you have a site without dunning strategy
   *
   * ```mermaid
   *   flowchart LR
   *     AS[Awaiting Signup] --> A{Activate}
   *     A -->|Success| Active
   *     A -->|Failure| ROF{revert_on_failure}
   *     ROF -->|true| AS
   *     ROF -->|false| Canceled
   * ```
   *
   * - Given you have a product with trial
   * - Given you have a site with dunning strategy
   *
   * ```mermaid
   *   flowchart LR
   *     AS[Awaiting Signup] --> A{Activate}
   *     A -->|Success| Trialing
   *     A -->|Failure| ROF{revert_on_failure}
   *     ROF -->|true| AS
   *     ROF -->|false| PD[Past Due]
   * ```
   *
   * ### Activate Trialing subscription
   *
   * For more information about the behavior of trialing subscriptions, see [Trialing
   * Subscriptions](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252155721869-Trialing-Subscriptions).
   * When the `revert_on_failure` parameter is set to `true`, the subscription's state remains
   * Trialing; the invoice from activation is voided, and any prepayments and credits applied to the
   * invoice are returned to the subscription.
   *

  /**
   * Create Subscription
   *
   * @remarks
   *
   * Creates a Subscription for a customer and product.
   *
   * Specify the product with `product_id` or `product_handle`. To set a specific product price
   * point, use `product_price_point_handle` or `product_price_point_id`.
   *
   * Identify an existing customer with `customer_id` or `customer_reference`. Optionally, include
   * an existing payment profile using `payment_profile_id`. To create a new customer, pass
   * customer_attributes.
   *
   * Select an option from the **Request Examples** drop-down on the right side of the portal to see
   * examples of common scenarios for creating subscriptions.
   *
   * ## List vs Sales Pricing
   *
   * When a subscription uses custom pricing as the sales price, you can optionally provide a list
   * price for any item. If omitted, the list price defaults to the sales price. The difference
   * between the list price and sales price is used to calculate implicit discounts, which appear on
   * Invoices and in reporting. List price can also support revenue allocations in [Advanced
   * Revenue](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/24177001342861-Create-and-Configure-RevenueBooks).
   *
   * If your site has list pricing enabled, the API accepts `custom_price.list_price_point_id` for
   * custom pricing, validates and persists it, and returns list price metadata in subscription
   * responses. If list pricing is disabled, this input is ignored and related response fields are
   * omitted.
   *
   * When list pricing is enabled:
   *
   * - Subscription → Product `product_price_point_list_price_point_id` (integer)
   * - `product_price_point_list_price_point_handle` (string)
   * - Subscription Components (when components are included in the response, such as with
   *   subscriptions built from components or component serialization paths) `component_id`
   *   (integer)
   * - `price_point_id` (integer)
   * - `list_price_point_id` (integer)
   *
   * When list pricing is disabled:
   *
   * - Subscription → Product `product_price_point_list_price_point_id`: omitted
   * - `product_price_point_list_price_point_handle`: omitted
   * - Subscription Components `list_price_point_id`: omitted
   *
   * This functionality is supported in the API, but is not currently supported in SDKs.
   *
   * ## Subscriptions can now work independently from the catalog
   *
   * If you have the new [Catalog
   * experience](page:help/announcements/2026-announcements#new-catalog-experience-and-terminology)
   * enabled, you can create subscriptions without a `product_id` or `product_handle` using POST
   * /subscriptions, building them entirely from components.
   *
   * A valid subscription must include at least one active component with:
   * - a positive `allocated_quantity`,
   * - a positive `unit_balance`, or
   * - 'enabled: true' (for on/off components)
   * - a configured metered component
   *
   * `component_id` can be provided as a numeric ID or in handle: format. If `trial_interval` and
   * `trial_interval_unit` are included, they are applied at creation.
   *
   * In the response, product and product price point fields are null, and component details are
   * returned instead.
   *
   * This functionality is supported in the API, but is not currently supported in SDKs.
   *
   * ## Payment information
   *
   * Payment information may be required to create a subscription, depending on the options for the
   * Product being subscribed. See [product
   * options](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/24261076617869-Edit-Products) for more
   * information. See the [Payments Profile]($e/Payment%20Profiles/createPaymentProfile) endpoint
   * for details on payment parameters. See the [Subscription
   * Signups](page:introduction/basic-concepts/subscription-signup) article for more information on
   * working with subscriptions in Advanced Billing.
   *
   * ## Payment information
   *
   * Payment information may be required to create a subscription, depending on the options for the
   * Product being subscribed. See [product
   * options](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/24261076617869-Edit-Products) for more
   * information. See the [Payments Profile]($e/Payment%20Profiles/createPaymentProfile) endpoint
   * for details on payment parameters.
   *
   * Do not use real card information for testing. See the Sites articles that cover [testing your
   * site
   * setup](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/24250712113165-Testing-Overview#testing-overview-0-0)
   * for more details on testing in your sandbox.
   *
   * Note that collecting and sending raw card details in production requires [PCI
   * compliance](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/24183956938381-PCI-Compliance#pci-compliance-0-0)
   * on your end. If your business is not PCI compliant, use [Maxio.js (formerly
   * Chargify.js)](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/38163190843789-Chargify-js-Overview#chargify-js-overview-0-0)
   * to collect credit card or bank account information.
   *
   * ## 3D Secure (3DS) Authentication post-authentication flow
   *
   * When a payment requires 3DS Authentication to adhere to Strong Customer Authentication (SCA),
   * the request enters a post-authentication flow where a 422 Unprocessable Entity status is
   * returned with an action_link that will direct the customer through 3DS Authentication.
   *
   * See the [3D Secure Post-Authentication
   * Flow](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/44277749524365-3D-Secure-Post-Authentication-Flow)
   * article in the product documentation to learn how to manage the redirect flow.

  /**
   * Override Subscription
   *
   * @remarks
   * Sets certain subscription fields that are usually managed automatically. Some of the fields can
   * be set via the normal Subscriptions Update API, but others can only be set using this endpoint.
   *
   * This endpoint is provided for cases where you need to “align” Advanced Billing data with data
   * that happened in your system, perhaps before you started using Advanced Billing. For example,
   * you may choose to import your historical subscription data, and would like the activation and
   * cancellation dates in Advanced Billing to match your existing historical dates. Advanced
   * Billing does not backfill historical events (i.e. from the Events API), but some static data
   * can be changed via this API.
   *
   * Why are some fields only settable from this endpoint, and not the normal subscription create
   * and update endpoints? Because we want users of this endpoint to be aware that these fields are
   * usually managed by Advanced Billing, and using this API means **you are stepping out on your
   * own.**
   *
   * Changing these fields will not affect any other attributes. For example, adding an expiration
   * date will not affect the next assessment date on the subscription.
   *
   * If you regularly need to override the current_period_starts_at for new subscriptions, this can
   * also be accomplished by setting both `previous_billing_at` and `next_billing_at` at
   * subscription creation. See the documentation on [Importing
   * Subscriptions](./b3A6MTQxMDgzODg-create-subscription#subscriptions-import) for more
   * information.
   *
   * ## Limitations
   *
   * When passing `current_period_starts_at` some validations are made:
   *
   * 1. The subscription needs to be unbilled (no statements or invoices).
   * 2. The value passed must be a valid date/time. We recommend using the iso 8601 format.
   * 3. The value passed must be before the current date/time.
   *
   * If unpermitted parameters are sent, a 400 HTTP response is sent along with a string giving the
   * reason for the problem.

   * @returns No Content

  /**
   * Preview Subscription
   *
   * @remarks
   * Previews a subscription by POSTing the same JSON or XML as for a subscription creation.
   *
   * The "Next Billing" amount and "Next Billing" date are represented in each Subscriber's Summary.
   *
   * This endpoint does not create a subscription; it is meant to serve as a prediction.
   *
   * For more information, see [Subscriber Interface
   * Overview](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252493695757-Subscriber-Interface-Overview).
   *
   * ## Subscriptions can now work independently from the catalog
   *
   * If you have the new [Catalog
   * experience](page:help/announcements/2026-announcements#new-catalog-experience-and-terminology)
   * enabled, you can create subscriptions without a `product_id` or `product_handle` using POST
   * /subscriptions, building them entirely from components.
   *
   * A valid subscription must include at least one active component with:
   * - a positive `allocated_quantity`,
   * - a positive `unit_balance`, or
   * - 'enabled: true' (for on/off components)
   *
   * `component_id` can be provided as a numeric ID or in handle: format. If `trial_interval` and
   * `trial_interval_unit` are included, they are applied at creation.
   *
   * In the response, product and product price point fields are null, and component details are
   * returned instead.
   *
   * This functionality is supported in the API, but is not currently supported in SDKs.
   *
   * ## Taxable Subscriptions
   *
   * This endpoint previews taxes applicable to a purchase. For taxes to be previewed, the following
   * conditions must be met:
   *
   * + Taxes must be configured on the subscription
   * + The preview must be for the purchase of a taxable product or component, or combination of the
   *   two.
   * + The subscription payload must contain a full billing or shipping address to calculate tax
   *
   * For more information about creating taxable previews, see
   * [Taxes](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/24287012349325-Taxes).
   *
   * You do **not** need to include a card number to generate tax information when you are
   * previewing a subscription. However, when you actually want to create the subscription, you must
   * include the credit card information if you want the billing address to be stored. The billing
   * address and the credit card information are stored together within the payment profile object.
   * Also, you cannot send a billing address without payment profile information, as the address is
   * stored on the card.
   *
   * You can pass shipping and billing addresses and still decide not to calculate taxes. To do
   * that, pass `skip_billing_manifest_taxes: true` attribute.
   *
   * ## Non-taxable Subscriptions
   *
   * If you'd like to calculate subscriptions that do not include tax, you can leave off the billing
   * information.
   *
   * @returns OK

  /**
   * Update Subscription
   *
   * @remarks
   * Updates one or more attributes of a subscription.
   *
   * ## Update Subscription Payment Method
   *
   * Change the card that your subscriber uses for their subscription. You can also use this method
   * to change the expiration date of the card **if your gateway allows**.
   *
   * Do not use real card information for testing. See the Sites articles that cover [testing your
   * site
   * setup](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/24250712113165-Testing-Overview#testing-overview-0-0)
   * for more details on testing in your sandbox.
   *
   * Note that collecting and sending raw card details in production requires [PCI
   * compliance](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/24183956938381-PCI-Compliance#pci-compliance-0-0)
   * on your end. If your business is not PCI compliant, use
   * [Chargify.js](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/38163190843789-Chargify-js-Overview#chargify-js-overview-0-0)
   * to collect credit card or bank account information.
   *
   * > Note: Partial card updates for **Authorize.Net** are not allowed via this endpoint. The
   * existing Payment Profile must be directly updated instead.
   *
   * ## Update Product
   *
   * You also use this method to change the subscription to a different product by setting a new
   * value for product_handle. A product change can be done in two different ways, **product
   * change** or **delayed product change**.
   *
   * ### Product Change
   *
   * You can change a subscription's product. The new payment amount is calculated and charged at
   * the normal start of the next period. If you require complex product changes or prorated
   * upgrades and downgrades instead, please see the documentation on [Migrating Subscription
   * Products](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252069837581-Product-Changes-and-Migrations#product-changes-and-migrations-0-0).
   *
   * To perform a product change, set either the `product_handle` or `product_id` attribute to that
   * of a different product from the same site as the subscription. You can also change the price
   * point by passing in either `product_price_point_id` or `product_price_point_handle` - otherwise
   * the new product's default price point is used.
   *
   * ### Delayed Product Change
   *
   * This method also changes the product and/or price point, and the new payment amount is
   * calculated and charged at the normal start of the next period.
   *
   * This method schedules the product change to happen automatically at the subscription’s next
   * renewal date. To perform a delayed product change, set the `product_handle` attribute as you
   * would in a regular product change, but also set the `product_change_delayed` attribute to
   * `true`. No proration applies in this case.
   *
   * You can also perform a delayed change to the price point by passing in either
   * `product_price_point_id` or `product_price_point_handle`
   *
   * > **Note:** To cancel a delayed product change, set `next_product_id` to an empty string.
   *
   * ## Billing Date Changes
   *
   * You can update dates for a subscription.
   *
   * ### Regular Billing Date Changes
   *
   * Send the `next_billing_at` to set the next billing date for the subscription. After that date
   * passes and the subscription is processed, the following billing date will be set according to
   * the subscription's product period.
   *
   * > Note: If you pass an invalid date, the correct date is automatically set to the correct date.
   * For example, if February 30 is passed, the next billing would be set to March 2nd in a non-leap
   * year.
   *
   * The server response will not return data under the key/value pair of `next_billing_at`. View
   * the key/value pair of `current_period_ends_at` to verify that the `next_billing_at` date has
   * been changed successfully.
   *
   * ### Calendar Billing and Snap Day Changes
   *
   * For a subscription using Calendar Billing, setting the next billing date is a bit different.
   * Send the `snap_day` attribute to change the calendar billing date for **a subscription using a
   * product eligible for calendar billing**.
   *
   * > Note: If you change the product associated with a subscription that contains a `snap_day` and
   * immediately READ/GET the subscription data, it will still contain the original `snap_day`. The
   * `snap_day` will be reset to `null` on the next billing cycle. This is because a product change
   * is instantaneous and only affects the product associated with a subscription.
   *
   * If you have the new [Catalog
   * experience](page:help/announcements/2026-announcements#new-catalog-experience-and-terminology)
   * enabled, some subscriptions may not have an associated product. For subscriptions without an
   * associated product, `product`, `product_price_point_id`, and `product_price_point_type` are
   * returned as `null`.
