  /**
   * Read Subscription Entitlements
   *
   * @remarks
   * Returns every feature a subscription is entitled to, collapsed into one entry per feature key
   * and periodicity window across all products and components on the subscription. A `usage_limit`
   * feature granted with two different periodicities comes back as two entries sharing one
   * `feature_key`, each identified by its own `periodicity_key`.
   *
   * When more than one product or component grants the same feature key and periodicity, the values
   * are combined:
   * - **`access_right`** features are combined with a boolean OR. If any contributor grants access,
   *   the aggregate is `true`. `source_products` only lists the contributors that granted `true`.
   * - **`usage_limit`** features are summed across every contributor sharing the same periodicity
   *   window. `source_products` lists every contributor. Grants with different periodicities are
   *   not summed together. Each periodicity is returned as a separate entry.
   * - **`service_right`** features are not combined: one contributor's value wins. Do not rely on
   *   which one when several grant the same feature key.
   *
   * `enabled` reflects both the aggregated value and the subscription's state. The field is `false`
   * whenever the subscription is not in a live state (`active`, `trialing`, `assessing`,
   * `past_due`, `soft_failure`), regardless of the aggregated value. Entitlements deliberately stay
   * enabled through dunning.
   *
   * @returns OK
   *
   * @throws {@link Entitlements.ReadSubscriptionEntitlementsError} when the API answers with an
   * error status — narrow on `err.payload.kind`
   *
   * @throws {@link MaxioError} when no usable response was produced: a connection failure, a
   * timeout, a body that would not decode, a value that would not encode, or a credential that
   * could not be obtained
