  /**
   * Issue advance invoice
   *
   * @remarks
   * Issues an invoice in advance for a subscription's next renewal date. For the most part, advance
   * invoices function like any other invoice, except they are issued early and have special
   * behavior upon being voided. For more information on advance invoices, including eligibility for
   * generating one, see [Issue Invoice In
   * Advance](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252026404749-Issue-Invoice-In-Advance).
   *
   * A subscription can only have one advance invoice per billing period. Attempting to issue an
   * advance invoice when one already exists returns an error.
   *
   * Regeneration of the invoice can be forced with the params `force: true`, which voids an advance
   * invoice if one exists and generates a new one. If no advance invoice exists, a new one is
   * generated.
   *
   * Consider using either the create or preview endpoints for proforma invoices to preview this
   * advance invoice before using this endpoint to generate it.
   *
   * @returns Created
   *
   * @throws {@link AdvanceInvoice.IssueAdvanceInvoiceError} when the API answers with an error
   * status — narrow on `err.payload.kind`
   *
   * @throws {@link MaxioError} when no usable response was produced: a connection failure, a
   * timeout, a body that would not decode, a value that would not encode, or a credential that
   * could not be obtained
