  /**
   * Migrate Subscription Product
   *
   * @remarks
   * Migrates a subscription to a different product.
   *
   * To create a migration, you must pass the `product_id` or `product_handle` in the object when
   * you send a POST request. You can also pass either a `product_price_point_id` or
   * `product_price_point_handle` to choose which price point the subscription is moved to. If no
   * price point identifier is passed, the subscription is moved to the product's default price
   * point. The response is the updated subscription.
   *
   * ## Valid Subscriptions
   *
   * Subscriptions should be in the `active` or `trialing` state to be migrated.
   *
   * (For backwards compatibility reasons, it is possible to migrate a subscription that is in the
   * `trial_ended` state via the API, however this is not recommended. Since `trial_ended` is an
   * end-of-life state, the subscription should be canceled, the product changed, and then the
   * subscription can be reactivated.)
   *
   * For more information, see [Product Changes and
   * Migrations](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252069837581-Product-Changes-and-Migrations).
   *
   * ## Failed Migrations
   *
   * Important note: One of the most common ways that a migration can fail is when the attempt is
   * made to migrate a subscription to its current product.
   *
   * ## 3D Secure (3DS) Authentication post-authentication flow
   *
   * When a payment requires 3DS Authentication to adhere to Strong Customer Authentication (SCA),
   * the request enters a post-authentication flow where a 422 Unprocessable Entity status is
   * returned with an action_link that will direct the customer through 3DS Authentication.
   *
   * See the [3D Secure Post-Authentication
   * Flow](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/44277749524365-3D-Secure-Post-Authentication-Flow)
   * article in the product documentation to learn how to manage the redirect flow.
   *
   * @returns OK
   *
   * @throws {@link SubscriptionProducts.MigrateSubscriptionProductError} when the API answers with
   * an error status — narrow on `err.payload.kind`
   *
   * @throws {@link MaxioError} when no usable response was produced: a connection failure, a
   * timeout, a body that would not decode, a value that would not encode, or a credential that
   * could not be obtained

   * @remarks

   *
   * ## Previewing a future date
   * It is also possible to preview the migration for a date in the future, as long as it's still
   * within the subscription's current billing period, by passing a `proration_date` along with the
   * request (e.g., `"proration_date": "2020-12-18T18:25:43.511Z"`).
